            Shannon started HelloFresh in 2014 so she and her husband could
            enjoy good home cooked meals without the stress of meal planning.
            When baby number 1 came along, followed closely by another little
            bundle of joy, they upgraded from the classic box to the family meal
            box.<br />

            The recipes they've cooked over their time with HelloFresh have
            quickly become family favourites - especially the Moreish Pumpkin
            Risotto with Bacon & Parmesan Cheese. Storing all of their favourite
            recipes in a folder has become a great way to simplify dinner time
            even more; "we've cooked the risotto for people at dinner parties -
            it was a hit!" <br />

            Shannon loves that every week with HelloFresh brings something
            different. "If it got boring, we would have stopped at some point,
            and it just never seems to get boring." <br />

            Watch this space to see more stories from the kitchens of
            HelloFreshers all over Australia.
